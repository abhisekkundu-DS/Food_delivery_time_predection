# 🍽️ Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project predicts the estimated delivery time for food orders using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to improve logistics efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 📚 Features

- Preprocessing of numerical and textual features from orders
- NLP-based analysis of delivery instructions or addresses
- Regression models trained to forecast delivery times
- Visualizations to explore relationships between distance, time, and weather

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Plotly for visualization
- NLTK / spaCy for NLP
- Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
- Optional: Flask for deployment

## 📝 Dataset

File: `deliverytime.txt`  
Contents:
- `Delivery Instructions` or textual address info
- `Distance (km)`
- `Order Time`
- `Weather Conditions`
- `Actual Delivery Time`

Ensure the `.txt` file is in proper tabular (CSV-like) format.

## 📈 Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & EDA
2. NLP on text features
3. Feature engineering (e.g. time extraction)
4. Train/Test split
5. Model training using regression algorithms (e.g. Linear Regression, XGBoost)
6. Evaluation with RMSE, MAE, R² Score
